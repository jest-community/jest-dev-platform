# Community Packages

Jest is a highly extensible testing framework and the community has many packages out there that help enhance Jest. We are going to look at two ways we can extend Jest to improve your workflow/setup.

## Exercise 1

Jest allows for a global function to be ran before your tests so you can bind something globally across all tests using `setupEnvFiles`.



- `setupEnvFiles` (logger)
- `expect` (some custom expect)
