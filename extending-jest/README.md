# Extending Jest 

Jest is a highly extensible testing framework and the community has many packages out there that help enhance Jest. We are going to look at two ways we can extend Jest to improve your workflow/setup.

## Expect Exercise

- Extend `expect` with custom matcher: see [./expect](./expect)

## Snapshot serializer Exercise

- Add customer snapshot serializer: see [./snapshot-serializer](./snapshot-serializer)
